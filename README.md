## Blackjack Project

#### Week 3 Skill Distillery Weekend Homework (AKA OMG) 

### Initial thoughts
We have the deck structure already from class 
Where to go from here: 
1. Need a dealer 
 	Create a class for this, instantiate in main?
2. Need a player 
	Create a class for this, instantiate in main?
3. I want to display the cumulative value of the hand, too


11:35 PM Sat // realized I made an error, have had poker
on the brain, not Blackjack. Haven't lost too much 
time as mechanically I'm still stuck at passing cards to a hand.

12:41 AM Sun // GOT IT!!! Figured out how to pass the value to the individual hands! Also 
figured out how to retrieve their individual values so I can count them! 

1:23 AM Sun // have to get some sleep, working on the logic of the numbers right now. Interesting 
issues popping up like keeping a good run count 

9:05 AM Sun // back at it, having made kids breakfast. Could use another coffee. Working on game logic/flow. 
I know I'm doing this the laborious way with too many if statements. If I can make this function, I think 
I can consolidate the code.

10:43 AM Sun // have to spend some time with my family, have some more functionality working 

3:54 PM Sun // I believe I have the scoring done correctly, working on flow right now 

8:51 PM Sun // moved from a series of if statements to a boolean while loop. Not quite working but much simpler code...if I can make it work

11:04 PM Sun // it's not perfect but I think I've taken it as far as I can w/out a rested set of eyes on it. Lots of lessons 
learned in this one, from instaniating hands / arrayLists to retrieving the values and comparing the same

11:10 PM Sun // can't stop, few more tweaks, cleaned up the code

11:34 PM Sun // added a condition to allow a second hit, working on showing the dealers hit cards after the first

11:41 PM Sun // ok, calling it. One problem I am aware of: I can't seem to hit more than once but I have to turn in to be 
able to be functional tomorrow 

5:34 PM Wednesday // a number of lessons learned in this project, from framing failures to logic flow!
