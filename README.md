## Blackjack Project

#### Week 3 Skill Distillery Weekend Homework (AKA OMG) 

### Initial thoughts
We have the deck structure already from class 
Where to go from here: 
1. Need a dealer 
 	Create a class for this, instantiate in main?
2. Need a player 
	Create a class for this, instantiate in main?
3. I want to display the cumulative value of the hand, too


11:35 PM Sat // realized I made an error, have had poker
on the brain, not Blackjack. Haven't lost too much 
time as mechanically I'm still stuck at passing cards to a hand.


 - Need to keep a running count of the card deck 
 - Want to put a random "waitress shows up w a drink!"
 - Should game end on 21 by player?
